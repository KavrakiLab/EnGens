	abstract = {Unveiling the mechanistic features of drug-target binding is of central interest in biophysics and drug discovery. Herein, we address this challenge by combining two major computational approaches, namely, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov State Models (MSM), with a Path Collective Variables (PCVs) description coupled with metadynamics. We apply our methodology to reconstruct the binding process of the antagonist alprenolol to the β2-adrenergic receptor, a well-established pharmaceutical target. The devised protocol allowed us to estimate the binding free energy and identify the minimum free energy path leading to the protein–ligand complex. In summary, we show that MSM and PCVs can be efficiently integrated to shed light upon mechanistic and energetic details underlying complex recognition processes in biological systems.},

	abstract = {A goal in the kinetic characterization of a macromolecular system is the description of its slow relaxation processes via (i) identification of the structural changes involved in these processes and (ii) estimation of the rates or timescales at which these slow processes occur. Most of the approaches to this task, including Markov models, master-equation models, and kinetic network models, start by discretizing the high-dimensional state space and then characterize relaxation processes in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a discrete transition matrix. The practical success of such an approach depends very much on the ability to finely discretize the slow order parameters. How can this task be achieved in a high-dimensional configuration space without relying on subjective guesses of the slow order parameters? In this paper, we use the variational principle of conformation dynamics to derive an optimal way of identifying the “slow subspace” of a large set of prior order parameters – either generic internal coordinates or a user-defined set of parameters. Using a variational formulation of conformational dynamics, it is shown that an existing method—the time-lagged independent component analysis—provides the optional solution to this problem. In addition, optimal indicators—order parameters indicating the progress of the slow transitions and thus may serve as reaction coordinates—are readily identified. We demonstrate that the slow subspace is well suited to construct accurate kinetic models of two sets of molecular dynamics simulations, the 6-residue fluorescent peptide MR121-GSGSW and the 30-residue intrinsically disordered peptide kinase inducible domain (KID). The identified optimal indicators reveal the structural changes associated with the slow processes of the molecular system under analysis.},

	abstract = {Generation and analysis of time-series data is relevant to many quantitative fields ranging from economics to fluid mechanics. In the physical sciences, structures such as metastable and coherent sets, slow relaxation processes, collective variables, dominant transition pathways or manifolds and channels of probability flow can be of great importance for understanding and characterizing the kinetic, thermodynamic and mechanistic properties of the system. Deeptime is a general purpose Python library offering various tools to estimate dynamical models based on time-series data including conventional linear learning methods, such as Markov state models (MSMs), Hidden Markov Models and Koopman models, as well as kernel and deep learning approaches such as VAMPnets and deep MSMs. The library is largely compatible with scikit-learn, having a range of Estimator classes for these different models, but in contrast to scikit-learn also provides deep Model classes, e.g. in the case of an MSM, which provide a multitude of analysis methods to compute interesting thermodynamic, kinetic and dynamical quantities, such as free energies, relaxation times and transition paths. The library is designed for ease of use but also easily maintainable and extensible code. In this paper we introduce the main features and structure of the deeptime software.

By adapting large language models (LLMs) for genomic data, we build genome-scale language models (GenSLMs) which can learn the evolutionary landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. By pretraining on over 110 million prokaryotic gene sequences and finetuning a SARS-CoV-2-specific model on 1.5 million genomes, we show that GenSLMs can accurately and rapidly identify variants of concern. Thus, to our knowledge, GenSLMs represents one of the first whole genome scale foundation models which can generalize to other prediction tasks. We demonstrate scaling of GenSLMs on GPU-based supercomputers and AI-hardware accelerators utilizing 1.63 Zettaflops in training runs with a sustained performance of 121 PFLOPS in mixed precision and peak of 850 PFLOPS. We present initial scientific insights from examining GenSLMs in tracking evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, paving the path to realizing this on large biological data.},

	abstract = {Transformer-based language models are successfully used to address massive text-related tasks. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism and its analysis provides valuable insights into gene regulation and biomarker identification. Several deep learning-based methods have been proposed to identify DNA methylation and each seeks to strike a balance between computational effort and accuracy. Here, we introduce a MuLan-Methyl, a deep learning framework for predicting DNA methylation sites, which is based on multiple (five) popular transformer-based language models. The framework identifies methylation sites for three different types of DNA methylation, namely N6-adenine (6mA), N4-cytosine (4mC), and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Each of the five employed language models is adapted to the task using the “pre-train and fine-tune” paradigm. Pre-training is performed on a custom corpus consisting of DNA fragments and taxonomy lineages using self-supervised learning. Fine-tuning then aims at predicting the DNA-methylation status of each type. The five models are used to collectively predict the DNA methylation status. We report excellent performance of MuLan-Methyl on a benchmark dataset. Moreover, we show that the model captures characteristic differences between different species that are relevant for methylation. This work demonstrates that language models can be successfully adapted to this domain of application and that joint utilization of different language models improves model performance.},

Recent work has explored learning biased sampling distributions to improve the time efficiency of these planners. However, learning such distributions is challenging, since there is no direct connection between the choice of distributions and the performance of the downstream planner. To alleviate this challenge, this letter proposes apes, a framework that learns sampling distributions optimized directly for the planner's performance. This is done using a critic, which serves as a differentiable surrogate objective modeling the planner's performance – thus allowing gradients to circumvent the non-differentiable planner. Leveraging the differentiability of the critic, we train a generator, which outputs sampling distributions optimized for the given problem instance. We evaluate apes on a series of realistic and challenging high-dof manipulation problems in simulation. Our experimental results demonstrate that apes can learn high-quality distributions that improve planning performance more than other biased sampling baselines.},

We show that GMM with cross-validation provides a robust estimate that is not subject to overfitting. The continuous nature of Gaussians provides better estimates on sparse data than canonical histogramming. We find that diffusion properties determine the sampling method effectiveness, such that diffusion-dominated apo calmodulin is most efficiently sampled by regular molecular dynamics, while holo calmodulin, with its rugged free energy landscape, is better sampled by enhanced sampling methods.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in the analysis of protein folding and other complex reactions is the determination of the reaction free energy landscape. The current experimental techniques lack the necessary spatial and temporal resolution to construct such landscapes. The properties of the landscapes can be probed only indirectly. Simulation, assuming that it reproduces the experimental dynamics, can provide the necessary spatial and temporal resolution. It is, arguably, the only way for direct rigorous construction of the quantitatively accurate free energy landscapes. Here, such landscape is constructed from the equilibrium folding simulation of FIP35 protein reported by Shaw et al. Science2010, 330, 341–346. For the dynamics to be accurately described as diffusion on the free energy landscape, the choice of reaction coordinates is crucial. The reaction coordinate used here is such that the dynamics projected on it is diffusive, so the description is consistent and accurate. The obtained landscape suggests an alternative interpretation of the simulation, markedly different from that of Shaw et al. In particular, FIP35 is not an incipient downhill folder, it folds via a populated on-pathway intermediate separated by high free energy barriers; the high free energy barriers rather than landscape roughness are a major determinant of the rates for conformational transitions; the preexponential factor of folding kinetics 1/k0 ∼ 10 ns rather than 1 μs.},

It first compares and contrasts fold switchers with other known types of proteins. Second, it presents examples of how various proteins can change their functions through fold switching. Third, it demonstrates that fold switchers can regulate biological processes by discussing two proteins, RfaH and KaiB, whose dramatic secondary structure remodeling events directly affect gene expression and a circadian clock, respectively. Finally, this minireview discusses how the field of protein fold switching might advance.},

	abstract = {Proteins are the molecular machines of life. The multitude of possible conformations that proteins can adopt determines their free-energy landscapes. However, the inherently high dimensionality of a protein free-energy landscape poses a challenge to deciphering how proteins perform their functions. For this reason, dimensionality reduction is an active field of research for molecular biologists. The uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) is a dimensionality reduction method based on a fuzzy topological analysis of data. In the present study, the performance of UMAP is compared with that of other popular dimensionality reduction methods such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), principal component analysis (PCA), and time-structure independent components analysis (tICA) in the context of analyzing molecular dynamics simulations of the circadian clock protein VIVID. A good dimensionality reduction method should accurately represent the data structure on the projected components. The comparison of the raw high-dimensional data with the projections obtained using different dimensionality reduction methods based on various metrics showed that UMAP has superior performance when compared with linear reduction methods (PCA and tICA) and has competitive performance and scalable computational cost.},

The algorithm is ∼4 times faster than CE and 20 times faster than DALI and SAL. On average, the resulting structure alignments have higher accuracy and coverage than those provided by these most often-used methods. TM-align is applied to an all-against-all structure comparison of 10 515 representative protein chains from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a sequence identity cutoff \&lt;95\%: 1996 distinct folds are found when a TM-score threshold of 0.5 is used. We also use TM-align to match the models predicted by TASSER for solved non-homologous proteins in PDB. For both folded and misfolded models, TM-align can almost always find close structural analogs, with an average root mean square deviation, RMSD, of 3 Å and 87\% alignment coverage. Nevertheless, there exists a significant correlation between the correctness of the predicted structure and the structural similarity of the model to the other proteins in the PDB. This correlation could be used to assist in model selection in blind protein structure predictions. The TM-align program is freely downloadable at http://bioinformatics.buffalo.edu/TM-align .},

	abstract = {Molecular simulations enable the study of biomolecules and their dynamics on an atomistic scale. A common task is to compare several simulation conditions - like mutations or different ligands - to find significant differences and interrelations between them. However, the large amount of data produced for ever larger and more complex systems often renders it difficult to identify the structural features that are relevant for a particular phenomenon. We present a flexible software package named PENSA that enables a comprehensive and thorough investigation into biomolecular conformational ensembles. It provides a wide variety of featurizations and feature transformations that allow for a complete representation of biomolecules like proteins and nucleic acids, including water and ion cavities within the biomolecular structure, thus avoiding bias that would come with manual selection of features. PENSA implements various methods to systematically compare the distributions of these features across ensembles to find the significant differences between them and identify regions of interest. It also includes a novel approach to quantify the state-specific information between two regions of a biomolecule which allows, e.g., the tracing of information flow to identify signaling pathways. PENSA also comes with convenient tools for loading data and visualizing results in ways that make them quick to process and easy to interpret. PENSA is an open-source Python library maintained at https://github.com/drorlab/pensa along with an example workflow and a tutorial. Here we demonstrate its usefulness in real-world examples by showing how it helps to determine molecular mechanisms efficiently.},

However, the estimation, validation, and analysis of such models is far from trivial and involves sophisticated and often numerically sensitive methods. In this work we present the open-source Python package PyEMMA (http://pyemma.org) that provides accurate and efficient algorithms for kinetic model construction. PyEMMA can read all common molecular dynamics data formats, helps in the selection of input features, provides easy access to dimension reduction algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA) and time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA) and clustering algorithms such as k-means, and contains estimators for MSMs, hidden Markov models, and several other models. Systematic model validation and error calculation methods are provided. PyEMMA offers a wealth of analysis functions such that the user can conveniently compute molecular observables of interest. We have derived a systematic and accurate way to coarse-grain MSMs to few states and to illustrate the structures of the metastable states of the system. Plotting functions to produce a manuscript-ready presentation of the results are available. In this work, we demonstrate the features of the software and show new methodological concepts and results produced by PyEMMA.},

To validate the workflow and highlight its capabilities, hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics (MC/MD) simulations are performed for SPC/E water in the isobaric–isothermal (NPT) and grand canonical (GC) ensembles as well as with Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC). The hybrid MC/MD approach shows close agreement with reference MC simulations and has a computational efficiency that is 2 to 136 times greater than traditional Monte Carlo simulations. MC/MD simulations performed for water in a graphene slit pore illustrate significant gains in sampling efficiency when the coupled–decoupled configurational-bias MC (CD–CBMC) algorithm is used compared with simulations using a single unbiased random trial position. Simulations using CD–CBMC reach equilibrium with 25 times fewer cycles than simulations using a single unbiased random trial position, with a small increase in computational cost. In a more challenging application, hybrid grand canonical Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics (GCMC/MD) simulations are used to hydrate a buried binding pocket in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. Water occupancies produced by GCMC/MD simulations are in close agreement with crystallographically identified positions, and GCMC/MD simulations have a computational efficiency that is 5 times better than MD simulations. py-MCMD is available on GitHub at https://github.com/GOMC-WSU/py-MCMD.},

In mid 2021, the database has almost 180,000 structures solved by X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, cryo-electron microscopy, and other methods. Many proteins have been studied under different conditions, including binding partners such as ligands, nucleic acids, or other proteins; mutations, and post-translational modifications, thus enabling extensive comparative structure-function studies. However, these studies are made more difficult because authors are allowed by the PDB to number the amino acids in each protein sequence in any manner they wish. This results in the same protein being numbered differently in the available PDB entries. For instance, some authors may include N-terminal signal peptides or the N-terminal methionine in the sequence numbering and others may not. In addition to the coordinates, there are many fields that contain structural and functional information regarding specific residues numbered according to the author. Here we provide a webserver and Python3 application that fixes the PDB sequence numbering problem by replacing the author numbering with numbering derived from the corresponding UniProt sequences. We obtain this correspondence from the SIFTS database from PDBe. The server and program can take a list of PDB entries or a list of UniProt identifiers (e.g., “P04637” or “P53\_HUMAN”) and provide renumbered files in mmCIF format and the legacy PDB format for both asymmetric unit files and biological assembly files provided by PDBe.},

GMXPBSA 2.0 is flexible and can easily be customized to specific needs. Additionally, it performs computational alanine scanning (CAS) to study the effects of ligand and/or receptor alanine mutations on the free energy of binding. Calculations require only for protein–protein or protein–ligand MD simulations. GMXPBSA 2.0 performs different comparative analysis, including a posteriori generation of alanine mutants of the wild-type complex, calculation of the binding free energy values of the mutant complexes and comparison of the results with the wild-type system. Moreover, it compares the binding free energy of different complexes trajectories, allowing the study the effects of non-alanine mutations, post-translational modifications or unnatural amino acids on the binding free energy of the system under investigation. Finally, it can calculate and rank relative affinity to the same receptor utilizing MD simulations of proteins in complex with different ligands. In order to dissect the different MM/PBSA energy contributions, including molecular mechanic (MM), electrostatic contribution to solvation (PB) and nonpolar contribution to solvation (SA), the tool combines two freely available programs: the MD simulations software GROMACS and the Poisson–Boltzmann equation solver APBS. All the calculations can be performed in single or distributed automatic fashion on a cluster facility in order to increase the calculation by dividing frames across the available processors. The program is freely available under the GPL license.

Nature of problem: Calculates the Molecular Mechanics (MM) data (Lennard-Jones and Coulomb terms) and the solvation energy terms (polar and nonpolar terms respectively) from an ensemble of structures derived from GROMACS molecular dynamics simulation trajectory. These calculations are performed for each single component of the simulated complex, including protein and ligand. In order to cancel out artefacts an identical grid setup for each component, including complex, protein and ligand, is required. Performs statistical analysis on the extracted data and comparison with wild-type complex in case of either computational alanine scanning or calculations on a set of simulations. Evaluates possible outliers in the frames extracted from the simulations during the binding free energy calculations. Solution method: The tool combines the freely available programs GROMACS and APBS to: 1.extract frames from a single or multiple complex molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, allowing comparison between multiple trajectories;2.split the complex frames in the single components including complex, protein and ligand;3.calculate the Lennard-Jones and Coulomb energy values (MM terms);4.calculate the polar solvation energy values using the implicit solvation Poisson–Boltzmann model (PB);5.calculate the nonpolar solvation energy value based on the solvent accessible surface area (SASA);6.combine all the calculated terms into the final binding free energy value;7.repeat the same procedure from point 1 to 6 for each simulation in case of computational alanine scanning (CAS) or simultaneous comparison of different MDs. Restrictions: Input format files compatible with GROMACS engine 4.5 and later versions. Availability of the force field or of the topology files. Running time: On a single core, Lennard-Jones, Coulomb and nonpolar solvation terms calculations require a few minutes. The time required for polar solvation terms calculations depends on the system size.},

	abstract = {An unprecedented research effort has been undertaken in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This has included the determination of hundreds of crystallographic structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, and numerous virtual screening projects searching large compound libraries for potential drug inhibitors. Unfortunately, these initiatives have had very limited success in producing effective inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A reason might be an often overlooked factor in these computational efforts: receptor flexibility. To address this issue we have implemented a computational tool for ensemble docking with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We have extracted representative ensembles of protein conformations from the Protein Data Bank and from in silico molecular dynamics simulations. Twelve pre-computed ensembles of SARS-CoV-2 protein conformations have now been made available for ensemble docking via a user-friendly webserver called DINC-COVID (dinc-covid.kavrakilab.org). We have validated DINC-COVID using data on tested inhibitors of two SARS-CoV-2 proteins, obtaining good correlations between docking-derived binding energies and experimentally-determined binding affinities. Some of the best results have been obtained on a dataset of large ligands resolved via room temperature crystallography, and therefore capturing alternative receptor conformations. In addition, we have shown that the ensembles available in DINC-COVID capture different ranges of receptor flexibility, and that this diversity is useful in finding alternative binding modes of ligands. Overall, our work highlights the importance of accounting for receptor flexibility in docking studies, and provides a platform for the identification of new inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 proteins.,

The success of protease-inhibitors (PIs), however, is often limited by the emergence of protease mutations that can confer resistance to a specific drug, or even to multiple PIs. In the present study, we used bioinformatics tools to evaluate the impact of the unusual mutations D30V and V32E over the dynamics of the PR-Nelfinavir complex, considering that codons involved in these mutations were previously related to major drug resistance to Nelfinavir. Both studied mutations presented structural features that indicate resistance to Nelfinavir, each one with a different impact over the interaction with the drug. The D30V mutation triggered a subtle change in the PR structure, which was also observed for the well-known Nelfinavir resistance mutation D30N, while the V32E exchange presented a much more dramatic impact over the PR flap dynamics. Moreover, our in silico approach was also able to describe different binding modes of the drug when bound to different proteases, identifying specific features of HIV-1 subtype B and subtype C proteases.},

	abstract = {Atomistic or ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are widely used to predict thermodynamics and kinetics and relate them to molecular structure. A common approach to go beyond the time- and length-scales accessible with such computationally expensive simulations is the definition of coarse-grained molecular models. Existing coarse-graining approaches define an effective interaction potential to match defined properties of high-resolution models or experimental data. In this paper, we reformulate coarse-graining as a supervised machine learning problem. We use statistical learning theory to decompose the coarse-graining error and cross-validation to select and compare the performance of different models. We introduce CGnets, a deep learning approach, that learns coarse-grained free energy functions and can be trained by a force-matching scheme. CGnets maintain all physically relevant invariances and allow one to incorporate prior physics knowledge to avoid sampling of unphysical structures. We show that CGnets can capture all-atom explicit-solvent free energy surfaces with models using only a few coarse-grained beads and no solvent, while classical coarse-graining methods fail to capture crucial features of the free energy surface. Thus, CGnets are able to capture multibody terms that emerge from the dimensionality reduction.},

	abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

	abstract = {Among the methods for protein structure prediction, which is important in biological research, AlphaFold2 has demonstrated astonishing accuracy in the 14th Community Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP14). The accuracy is close to the level of experimental structure determination. Furthermore, AlphaFold2 predicts three-dimensional structures and estimates the accuracy of the predicted structures. AlphaFold2 outputs two model accuracy estimation scores, pLDDT, and pTM, enabling the user to judge the reliability of the predicted structures. Original research of AlphaFold2 showed that those scores had good correlations to actual prediction accuracy. However, it was unclear whether we could select a structure close to the native structure when multiple structures are predicted for a single protein. In this study, we generated several hundred structures with diﬀerent combinations of parameters for 500 proteins and veriﬁed the performance of the accuracy estimation scores of AlphaFold2. In addition, we compared those scores with existing accuracy estimation methods. As a result, pLDDT and pTM showed better performance than the existing accuracy estimation methods for AlphaFold2 structures. However, the estimation performance of relative accuracy of the scores was still insuﬃcient, and the improvement would be needed for further utilization of AlphaFold2.},

	abstract = {Background Internal motions enable proteins to explore a range of conformations, even in the vicinity of native state. The role of conformational fluctuations in the designated function of a protein is widely debated. Emerging evidence suggests that sub-groups within the range of conformations (or sub-states) contain properties that may be functionally relevant. However, low populations in these sub-states and the transient nature of conformational transitions between these sub-states present significant challenges for their identification and characterization. Methods and Findings To overcome these challenges we have developed a new computational technique, quasi-anharmonic analysis (QAA). QAA utilizes higher-order statistics of protein motions to identify sub-states in the conformational landscape. Further, the focus on anharmonicity allows identification of conformational fluctuations that enable transitions between sub-states. QAA applied to equilibrium simulations of human ubiquitin and T4 lysozyme reveals functionally relevant sub-states and protein motions involved in molecular recognition. In combination with a reaction pathway sampling method, QAA characterizes conformational sub-states associated with cis/trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerization catalyzed by the enzyme cyclophilin A. In these three proteins, QAA allows identification of conformational sub-states, with critical structural and dynamical features relevant to protein function. Conclusions Overall, QAA provides a novel framework to intuitively understand the biophysical basis of conformational diversity and its relevance to protein function.},

This review aims to present the unifying principles and differences of many of the computational methods currenly used for enhanced sampling in molecular simulations of biomolecules, soft matter and molecular crystals. Indeed, despite the apparent abundance and divergence of such methods, the principles at their core can be boiled down to a relatively limited number of statistical and physical principles. To enable comparisons, the various methods are introduced using similar terminology and notation. We then illustrate in which ways many different methods combine principles from a smaller class of enhanced sampling concepts. This review is intended for scientists with an understanding of the basics of molecular dynamics simulations and statistical physics who want a deeper understanding of the ideas that underlie various enhanced sampling methods and the relationships between them. This living review is intended to be updated to continue to reflect the wealth of sampling methods as they continue to emerge in the literature.},

	abstract = {Coarse graining enables the investigation of molecular dynamics for larger systems and at longer timescales than is possible at an atomic resolution. However, a coarse graining model must be formulated such that the conclusions we draw from it are consistent with the conclusions we would draw from a model at a finer level of detail. It has been proved that a force matching scheme defines a thermodynamically consistent coarse-grained model for an atomistic system in the variational limit. Wang et al. [ACS Cent. Sci. 5, 755 (2019)] demonstrated that the existence of such a variational limit enables the use of a supervised machine learning framework to generate a coarse-grained force field, which can then be used for simulation in the coarse-grained space. Their framework, however, requires the manual input of molecular features to machine learn the force field. In the present contribution, we build upon the advance of Wang et al. and introduce a hybrid architecture for the machine learning of coarse-grained force fields that learn their own features via a subnetwork that leverages continuous filter convolutions on a graph neural network architecture. We demonstrate that this framework succeeds at reproducing the thermodynamics for small biomolecular systems. Since the learned molecular representations are inherently transferable, the architecture presented here sets the stage for the development of machine-learned, coarse-grained force fields that are transferable across molecular systems.},

The nature of these conformations and their relative probabilities are described by a high-dimensional free energy landscape. While computer simulation techniques such as molecular dynamics simulations allow characterisation of the metastable conformational states and the transitions between them, and thus free energy landscapes, to be characterised, the barriers between states can be high, precluding efficient sampling without substantial computational resources. Over the past decades, a dizzying array of methods have emerged for enhancing conformational sampling, and for projecting the free energy landscape onto a reduced set of dimensions that allow conformational states to be distinguished, known as collective variables (CVs), along which sampling may be directed. Here, a brief description of what biomolecular simulation entails is followed by a more detailed exposition of the nature of CVs and methods for determining these, and, lastly, an overview of the myriad different approaches for enhancing conformational sampling, most of which rely upon CVs, including new advances in both CV determination and conformational sampling due to machine learning.},

In the life sciences, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model contains information about biological properties in its representations. The representations are learned from sequence data alone. The learned representation space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.},

	abstract = {Abstract Efficient identification of drug mechanisms of action remains a challenge. Computational docking approaches have been widely used to predict drug binding targets; yet, such approaches depend on existing protein structures, and accurate structural predictions have only recently become available from AlphaFold2. Here, we combine AlphaFold2 with molecular docking simulations to predict protein-ligand interactions between 296 proteins spanning Escherichia coli's essential proteome, and 218 active antibacterial compounds and 100 inactive compounds, respectively, pointing to widespread compound and protein promiscuity. We benchmark model performance by measuring enzymatic activity for 12 essential proteins treated with each antibacterial compound. We confirm extensive promiscuity, but find that the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) is 0.48, indicating weak model performance. We demonstrate that rescoring of docking poses using machine learning-based approaches improves model performance, resulting in average auROCs as large as 0.63, and that ensembles of rescoring functions improve prediction accuracy and the ratio of true-positive rate to false-positive rate. This work indicates that advances in modeling protein-ligand interactions, particularly using machine learning-based approaches, are needed to better harness AlphaFold2 for drug discovery.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) allows the study of biological and chemical systems at the atomistic level on timescales from femtoseconds to milliseconds. It complements experiment while also offering a way to follow processes difficult to discern with experimental techniques. Numerous software packages exist for conducting MD simulations of which one of the widest used is termed Amber. Here, we outline the most recent developments, since version 9 was released in April 2006, of the Amber and AmberTools MD software packages, referred to here as simply the Amber package. The latest release represents six years of continued development, since version 9, by multiple research groups and the culmination of over 33 years of work beginning with the first version in 1979. The latest release of the Amber package, version 12 released in April 2012, includes a substantial number of important developments in both the scientific and computer science arenas. We present here a condensed vision of what Amber currently supports and where things are likely to head over the coming years. Figure 1 shows the performance in ns/day of the Amber package version 12 on a single-core AMD FX-8120 8-Core 3.6GHz CPU, the Cray XT5 system, and a single GPU GTX680. © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

While the structural features that distinguish between the active and inactive states of protein kinases are well established, that has not been the case for lipid kinases, and neither was the structural mechanism controlling the switch between the two states. Class I PI3Ks are obligate heterodimers with catalytic and regulatory subunits. Here, we analyze PI3K crystal structures. Structures with the nSH2 (inactive state) are featured by collapsed activation loop (a-loop) and an IN kinase domain helix 11 (kα11). In the active state, the a-loop is extended and kα11 in the OUT conformation. Our analysis suggests that the nSH2 domain in the regulatory subunit regulates activation, catalysis and autoinhibition through the a-loop. Inhibition, activation and catalytic scenarios are shared by class IA PI3Ks; the activation is mimicked by oncogenic mutations and the inhibition offers an allosteric inhibitor strategy.},

	abstract = {Cellular pathways controlling chemotaxis, growth, survival, and oncogenesis are activated by receptor tyrosine kinases and small G-proteins of the Ras superfamily that stimulate specific isoforms of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). These PI3K lipid kinases phosphorylate the constitutive lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Progress has been made in understanding direct, moderate PI3K activation by receptors. In contrast, the mechanism by which receptors and Ras synergistically activate PI3K to much higher levels remains unclear, and two competing models have been proposed: membrane recruitment versus activation of the membrane-bound enzyme. To resolve this central mechanistic question, this study employs single-molecule imaging to investigate PI3K activation in a six-component pathway reconstituted on a supported lipid bilayer. The findings reveal that simultaneous activation by a receptor activation loop (from platelet-derived growth factor receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase) and H-Ras generates strong, synergistic activation of PI3Kα, yielding a large increase in net kinase activity via the membrane recruitment mechanism. Synergy requires receptor phospho-Tyr and two anionic lipids (phosphatidylserine and PIP2) to make PI3Kα competent for bilayer docking, as well as for subsequent binding and phosphorylation of substrate PIP2 to generate product PIP3. Synergy also requires recruitment to membrane-bound H-Ras, which greatly speeds the formation of a stable, membrane-bound PI3Kα complex, modestly slows its off rate, and dramatically increases its equilibrium surface density. Surprisingly, H-Ras binding significantly inhibits the specific kinase activity of the membrane-bound PI3Kα molecule, but this minor enzyme inhibition is overwhelmed by the marked enhancement of membrane recruitment. The findings have direct impacts for the fields of chemotaxis, innate immunity, inflammation, carcinogenesis, and drug design.},

A., and Backer, J. M. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol. 18, 1379–1387). We now define the domains of p85 required for inhibition of p110α. The iSH2 domain of p85 is sufficient to bind p110α but does not inhibit it. Inhibition of p110α requires the presence of the nSH2 domain linked to the iSH2 domain. Phosphopeptides increase the activity of nSH2/iSH2-p110α dimers, demonstrating that the nSH2 domain mediates both inhibition of p110α and disinhibition by phosphopeptides. In contrast, phosphopeptides did not increase the activity of iSH2/cSH2-p110α dimers, or dimers composed of p110α and an nSH2/iSH2/cSH2 construct containing a mutant nSH2 domain. Phosphopeptide binding to the cSH2 domain increased p110α activity only in the context of an intact p85 containing both the nSH2 domain and residues 1–322 (the SH3, proline-rich and breakpoint cluster region-homolgy domains). These data suggest that the nSH2 domain of p85 is a direct regulator of p110α activity. Regulation of p110α by phosphopeptide binding to the cSH2 domain occurs by a mechanism that requires the additional presence of the nSH2 domain and residues 1–322 of p85.},

To improve the clinical efficacy and to reduce the toxic side effects of treatments, a deep characterization of genetic alterations in different tumors is required. The mutational profile often evidences a gain of function or hyperactivity of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) in tumors. These enzymes are activated downstream tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) and/or G proteins coupled receptors (GPCRs) and, via AKT, are able to induce mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) stimulation. Here, we elucidate the impact of class I (p110α, β, γ, and δ) catalytic subunit mutations on AKT-mediated cellular processes that control crucial mechanisms in tumor development. Moreover, the interrelation of PI3K signaling with mTOR, ERK, and RAS pathways will be discussed, exploiting the potential benefits of PI3K signaling inhibitors in clinical use.},

We used crystallographic and biochemical approaches to gain insight into activating mutations in two noncatalytic p110α domains—the adaptor-binding and the helical domains. A structure of the adaptor-binding domain of p110α in a complex with the p85α inter–Src homology 2 (inter-SH2) domain shows that oncogenic mutations in the adaptor-binding domain are not at the inter-SH2 interface but in a polar surface patch that is a plausible docking site for other domains in the holo p110/p85 complex. We also examined helical domain mutations and found that the Glu545 to Lys545 (E545K) oncogenic mutant disrupts an inhibitory charge-charge interaction with the p85 N-terminal SH2 domain. These studies extend our understanding of the architecture of PI3Ks and provide insight into how two classes of mutations that cause a gain in function can lead to cancer.},

The first structure shows key interactions of the N-terminal SH2 domain (nSH2) and iSH2 with the activation loop that suggest a mechanism by which the enzyme is inhibited in its basal state. In the second structure, the lipid substrate binds in a positively charged pocket adjacent to the ATP-binding site, bordered by the P-loop, the activation loop and the iSH2 domain. An additional lipid-binding site was identified at the interface of the ABD, iSH2 and kinase domains. The ability of PI3Kα to bind an additional PIP2 molecule was confirmed in vitro by fluorescence quenching experiments. The crystal structures reveal key differences in the way the nSH2 domain interacts with wild-type p110α and with the oncogenic mutant p110αH1047R. Increased buried surface area and two unique salt-bridges observed only in the wild-type structure suggest tighter inhibition in the wild-type PI3Kα than in the oncogenic mutant. These differences may be partially responsible for the increased basal lipid kinase activity and increased membrane binding of the oncogenic mutant.},

	abstract = {Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are implicated in a broad spectrum of cellular activities, such as growth, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and metabolism. Activation of class I PI3Ks by mutation or overexpression correlates with the development and maintenance of various human cancers. These PI3Ks are heterodimers, and the activity of the catalytic subunits is tightly controlled by the associated regulatory subunits. Although the same p85 regulatory subunits associate with all class IA PI3Ks, the functional outcome depends on the isotype of the catalytic subunit. New PI3K partners that affect the signaling by the PI3K heterodimers have been uncovered, including phosphate and tensin homolog (PTEN), cyclic adenosine monophosphate–dependent protein kinase (PKA), and nonstructural protein 1. Interactions with PI3K regulators modulate the intrinsic membrane affinity and either the rate of phosphoryl transfer or product release. Crystal structures for the class I and class III PI3Ks in complexes with associated regulators and inhibitors have contributed to developing isoform-specific inhibitors and have shed light on the numerous regulatory mechanisms controlling PI3K activation and inhibition.},

Current methods employ transformation of simulated coordinates into structural features, dimension reduction, clustering the dimension-reduced data, and estimation of a Markov state model or related model of the interconversion rates between molecular structures. This handcrafted approach demands a substantial amount of modeling expertise, as poor decisions at any step will lead to large modeling errors. Here we employ the variational approach for Markov processes (VAMP) to develop a deep learning framework for molecular kinetics using neural networks, dubbed VAMPnets. A VAMPnet encodes the entire mapping from molecular coordinates to Markov states, thus combining the whole data processing pipeline in a single end-to-end framework. Our method performs equally or better than state-of-the-art Markov modeling methods and provides easily interpretable few-state kinetic models.},

It is challenging to intuit these slow CVs for all but the simplest molecular systems, and their data-driven discovery directly from molecular simulation trajectories has been a central focus of the molecular simulation community to both unveil the important physical mechanisms and drive enhanced sampling. In this work, we introduce state-free reversible VAMPnets (SRV) as a deep learning architecture that learns nonlinear CV approximants to the leading slow eigenfunctions of the spectral decomposition of the transfer operator that evolves equilibrium-scaled probability distributions through time. Orthogonality of the learned CVs is naturally imposed within network training without added regularization. The CVs are inherently explicit and differentiable functions of the input coordinates making them well-suited to use in enhanced sampling calculations. We demonstrate the utility of SRVs in capturing parsimonious nonlinear representations of complex system dynamics in applications to 1D and 2D toy systems where the true eigenfunctions are exactly calculable and to molecular dynamics simulations of alanine dipeptide and the WW domain protein.},

We sequentially address early studies that motivated the method, canonical papers that established the use of MSMs for MD analysis, and subsequent advances in software and analysis protocols.

	abstract = {Inference, prediction, and control of complex dynamical systems from time series is important in many areas, including financial markets, power grid management, climate and weather modeling, or molecular dynamics. The analysis of such highly nonlinear dynamical systems is facilitated by the fact that we can often find a (generally nonlinear) transformation of the system coordinates to features in which the dynamics can be excellently approximated by a linear Markovian model. Moreover, the large number of system variables often change collectively on large time- and length-scales, facilitating a low-dimensional analysis in feature space. In this paper, we introduce a variational approach for Markov processes (VAMP) that allows us to find optimal feature mappings and optimal Markovian models of the dynamics from given time series data. The key insight is that the best linear model can be obtained from the top singular components of the Koopman operator. This leads to the definition of a family of score functions called VAMP-r which can be calculated from data, and can be employed to optimize a Markovian model. In addition, based on the relationship between the variational scores and approximation errors of Koopman operators, we propose a new VAMP-E score, which can be applied to cross-validation for hyper-parameter optimization and model selection in VAMP. VAMP is valid for both reversible and nonreversible processes and for stationary and nonstationary processes or realizations.},

Recent work has introduced the time-structure based Independent Components Analysis (tICA) method for analyzing MD, which attempts to find the slowest decorrelating linear functions of the molecular coordinates. This method has been used in conjunction with Markov State Models (MSMs) to provide estimates of the characteristic eigenprocesses contained in a simulation (e.g., protein folding, ligand binding). Here, we extend the tICA method using the kernel trick to arrive at nonlinear solutions.

This approach has many appealing characteristics compared to straightforward molecular dynamics simulation and analysis, including the potential to mitigate the sampling problem by extracting long-time kinetic information from short trajectories and the ability to straightforwardly calculate expectation values and statistical uncertainties of various stationary and dynamical molecular observables. In this paper, we summarize the current state of the art in generation and validation of MSMs and give some important new results. We describe an upper bound for the approximation error made by modeling molecular dynamics with a MSM and we show that this error can be made arbitrarily small with surprisingly little effort. In contrast to previous practice, it becomes clear that the best MSM is not obtained by the most metastable discretization, but the MSM can be much improved if non-metastable states are introduced near the transition states. Moreover, we show that it is not necessary to resolve all slow processes by the state space partitioning, but individual dynamical processes of interest can be resolved separately. We also present an efficient estimator for reversible transition matrices and a robust test to validate that a MSM reproduces the kinetics of the molecular dynamics data.},

This approach has been particularly successful for molecular dynamics data, where slowly decorrelating patterns can indicate large-scale conformational changes. Detecting such patterns is the central objective of the variational approach to conformational dynamics (VAC), as well as the related methods of time-lagged independent component analysis and Markov state modeling. In VAC, the search for slowly decorrelating patterns is formalized as a variational problem solved by the eigenfunctions of the system’s transition operator. VAC computes solutions to this variational problem by optimizing a linear or nonlinear model of the eigenfunctions using time series data. Here, we build on VAC’s success by addressing two practical limitations. First, VAC can give poor eigenfunction estimates when the lag time parameter is chosen poorly. Second, VAC can overfit when using flexible parametrizations such as artificial neural networks with insufficient regularization. To address these issues, we propose an extension that we call integrated VAC (IVAC). IVAC integrates over multiple lag times before solving the variational problem, making its results more robust and reproducible than VAC’s.},

While MHC binding is mostly influenced by the identity of the so-called anchor positions of the peptide, secondary interactions from nonanchor positions are known to play a role in complex stability. However, current MHC-binding prediction methods lack an analysis of the major conformational states and might underestimate the impact of secondary interactions. In this work, we present an atomically detailed analysis of peptide–MHC binding that can reveal the contributions of any interaction toward stability. We propose a simulation framework that uses both umbrella sampling and adaptive sampling to generate a Markov state model (MSM) for a coronavirus-derived peptide (QFKDNVILL), bound to one of the most prevalent MHC receptors in humans (HLA-A24:02). While our model reaffirms the importance of the anchor positions of the peptide in establishing stable interactions, our model also reveals the underestimated importance of position 4 (p4), a nonanchor position. We confirmed our results by simulating the impact of specific peptide mutations and validated these predictions through competitive binding assays. By comparing the MSM of the wild-type system with those of the D4A and D4P mutations, our modeling reveals stark differences in unbinding pathways. The analysis presented here can be applied to any peptide–MHC complex of interest with a structural model as input, representing an important step toward comprehensive modeling of the MHC class I pathway.},

	abstract = {The flux of ions and molecules in and out of the cell is vital for maintaining the basis of various biological processes. The permeation of substrates across the cellular membrane is mediated through the function of specialized integral membrane proteins commonly known as membrane transporters. These proteins undergo a series of structural rearrangements that allow a primary substrate binding site to be accessed from either side of the membrane at a given time. Structural insights provided by experimentally resolved structures of membrane transporters have aided in the biophysical characterization of these important molecular drug targets. However, characterizing the transitions between conformational states remains challenging to achieve both experimentally and computationally. Though molecular dynamics simulations are a powerful approach to provide atomistic resolution of protein dynamics, a recurring challenge is its ability to efficiently obtain relevant timescales of large conformational transitions as exhibited in transporters. One approach to overcome this difficulty is to adaptively guide the simulation to favor exploration of the conformational landscape, otherwise known as adaptive sampling. Furthermore, such sampling is greatly benefited by the statistical analysis of Markov state models. Historically, the use of Markov state models has been effective in quantifying slow dynamics or long timescale behaviors such as protein folding. Here, we review recent implementations of adaptive sampling and Markov state models to not only address current limitations of molecular dynamics simulations, but to also highlight how Markov state modeling can be applied to investigate the structure-function mechanisms of large, complex membrane transporters.},

In this context, intrinsically disordered proteins could be considered intrinsically multifunctional molecules, associated with multifunnel landscapes.

It assumes that folding occurs through organizing an ensemble of structures rather than through only a few uniquely defined structural intermediates. It suggests that the most realistic model of a protein is a minimally frustrated heteropolymer with a rugged funnel-like landscape biased toward the native structure. This statistical description has been developed using tools from the statistical mechanics of disordered systems, polymers, and phase transitions of finite systems. We review here its analytical background and contrast the phenomena in homopolymers, random heteropolymers, and protein-like heteropolymers that are kinetically and thermodynamically capable of folding. The connection between these statistical concepts and the results of minimalist models used in computer simulations is discussed. The review concludes with a brief discussion of how the theory helps in the interpretation of results from fast folding experiments and in the practical task of protein structure prediction.},

in particular, by the redistributions of the populations

The method considers the complete enzyme-substrate complex together with the surrounding solvent and evaluates all the different quantum mechanical and classical energy factors that can affect the reaction pathway. These factors include the quantum mechanical energies associated with bond cleavage and charge redistribution of the substrate and the classical energies of steric and electrostatic interactions between the substrate and the enzyme. The electrostatic polarization of the enzyme atoms and the orientation of the dipoles of the surrounding water molecules is simulated by a microscopic dielectric model. The solvation energy resulting from this polarization is considerable and must be included in any realistic calculation of chemical reactions involving anything more than an isolated molecule in vacuo. Without it, acidic groups can never become ionized and the charge distribution on the substrate will not be reasonable. The same dielectric model can also be used to study the reaction of the substrate in solution. In this way the reaction in solution can be compared with the enzymic reaction. In this paper we study the stability of the carbonium ion intermediate formed in the cleavage of a glycosidic bond by lysozyme. It is found that electrostatic stabilization is an important factor in increasing the rate of the reaction step that leads to the formation of the carbonium ion intermediate. Steric factors, such as the strain of the substrate on binding to lysozyme, do not seem to contribute significantly.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The tumor suppressor p53 is a phosphoprotein barely detectable in the nucleus of normal cells. Upon cellular stress, particularly that induced by DNA damage, p53 can arrest cell cycle progression, thus allowing the DNA to be repaired; or it can lead to apoptosis. These functions are achieved, in part, by the transactivational properties of p53, which activate a series of genes involved in cell cycle regulation. In cancer cells bearing a mutant p53, this protein is no longer able to control cell proliferation, resulting in inefficient DNA repair and the emergence of genetically unstable cells. The most common changes of p53 in human cancers are point missense mutations within the coding sequences of the gene. Such mutations are found in all major histogenetic groups, including cancers of the colon (60\%), stomach (60\%), breast (20\%), lung (70\%), brain (40\%), and esophagus (60\%). It is estimated that p53 mutations are the most frequent genetic event in human cancers, accounting for more than 50\% of cases. One of the most striking features of the inactive mutant p53 protein is its increased stability (half-life of several hours, compared to 20 min for wild-type p53) and its accumulation in the nucleus of neoplastic cells. Therefore, positive immunostaining is indicative of abnormalities of the p53 gene and its product. Several studies have shown that p53 mutations are associated with short survival in colorectal cancer, but the use of p53 as a tumoral marker is still a matter of debate.},

	abstract = {The bacterial elongation factor RfaH promotes the expression of virulence factors by specifically binding to RNA polymerases (RNAP) paused at a DNA signal. This behavior is unlike that of its paralog NusG, the major representative of the protein family to which RfaH belongs. Both proteins have an N-terminal domain (NTD) bearing an RNAP binding site, yet NusG C-terminal domain (CTD) is folded as a β-barrel while RfaH CTD is forming an α-hairpin blocking such site. Upon recognition of the specific DNA exposed by RNAP, RfaH is activated via interdomain dissociation and complete CTD structural rearrangement into a β-barrel structurally identical to NusG CTD. Although RfaH transformation has been extensively characterized computationally, little attention has been given to the role of the NTD in the fold-switching process, as its structure remains unchanged. Here, we used Associative Water-mediated Structure and Energy Model (AWSEM) molecular dynamics to characterize the transformation of RfaH, spotlighting the sequence-dependent effects of NTD on CTD fold stabilization. Umbrella sampling simulations guided by native contacts recapitulate the thermodynamic equilibrium experimentally observed for RfaH and its isolated CTD. Temperature refolding simulations of full-length RfaH show a high success towards α-folded CTD, whereas the NTD interferes with βCTD folding, becoming trapped in a β-barrel intermediate. Meanwhile, NusG CTD refolding is unaffected by the presence of RfaH NTD, showing that these NTD-CTD interactions are encoded in RfaH sequence. Altogether, these results suggest that the NTD of RfaH favors the α-folded RfaH by specifically orienting the αCTD upon interdomain binding and by favoring β-barrel rupture into an intermediate from which fold-switching proceeds.},

	abstract = {The stability of folded proteins is critical to their biological function and for the efficacy of protein therapeutics. Predicting the energetic effects of protein mutations can improve our fundamental understanding of structural biology, the molecular basis of diseases, and possible routes to addressing those diseases with biological drugs. Identifying the effect of single amino acid point mutations on the thermodynamic equilibrium between the folded and unfolded states of a protein can pinpoint residues of critical importance that should be avoided in the process of improving other properties (affinity, solubility, viscosity, etc.) and suggest changes at other positions for increasing stability in protein engineering. Multiple computational tools have been developed for in silico predictions of protein stability in recent years, ranging from sequence-based empirical approaches to rigorous physics-based free energy methods. In this work, we show that FEP+, which is a free energy perturbation method based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, can provide accurate thermal stability predictions for a wide range of biologically relevant systems. Significantly, the FEP+ approach, while originally developed for relative binding free energies of small molecules to proteins and not specifically fitted for protein stability calculations, performs well compared to other methods that were fitted specifically to predict protein stability. Here, we present the broadest validation of a rigorous free energy-based approach applied to protein stability reported to date: 700+ single-point mutations spanning 10 different protein targets. Across the entire data set, we correctly classify the mutations as stabilizing or destabilizing in 84\% of the cases, and obtain statistically significant predictions as compared with experiment [average error of {\textasciitilde}1.6kcal/mol and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.40]. This study demonstrates, for the first time in a large-scale validation, that rigorous free energy calculations can be used to predict changes in protein stability from point mutations without parameterization or system-specific customization, although further improvements should be possible with additional sampling and a better representation of the unfolded state of the protein. Here, we describe the FEP+ method as applied to protein stability calculations, summarize the large-scale retrospective validation results, and discuss limitations of the method, along with future directions for further improvements.},

This protein is expressed in all cell types but has a rapid turnover and is latent under normal conditions. p53 is mutated in most common human malignancies and behaves as a multifunctional transcription factor involved in the control of cell cycle, programmed cell death, senescence, differentiation and development, transcription, DNA replication, DNA repair, and maintenance of genomic stability. p53 is converted to an active form in response to a number of physical or chemical DNA-damaging agents such as X or gamma irradiation, UV rays, oxidizing agents, cytotoxic drugs, and cancer-causing chemicals. Induction of p53 implies nuclear retention, accumulation of the protein as a result of post-translational stabilization, and allosteric conversion to a form with high sequence-specific DNA-binding capacity. p53 is activated in response to DNA damage, thus acting as a “guardian of the genome” against genotoxic stress. The chapter describes a three-step model of pS3 activation by stress signals. The downstream pS3 signaling is mediated by transcriptional activation of specific genes and by complex formation between p53 and heterologous proteins. The mutations and variations in the p53 gene are due to p53 polymorphisms, somatic mutations, and germline mutations in p53. The chapter also accounts for p53 mutations in sporadic cancers focussing on host-environment interactions. The chapter concludes with the potential clinical applications of the detection of p53 mutations in human tissues.},

	abstract = {Proteins of the p53 family are expressed in vertebrates and in some invertebrate species. The main function of these proteins is to control and regulate cell cycle in response to various cellular signals, and therefore to control the organism’s development. The regulatory functions of the p53 family members originate mostly from their highly-conserved and well-structured DNA-binding domains. Many human diseases (including various types of cancer) are related to the missense mutations within this domain. The ordered DNA-binding domains of the p53 family members are surrounded by functionally important intrinsically disordered regions. In this study, substitution rates and propensities in different regions of p53 were analyzed. The analyses revealed that the ordered DNA-binding domain is conserved, whereas disordered regions are characterized by high sequence diversity. This diversity was reflected both in the number of substitutions and in the types of substitutions to which each amino acid was prone. These results support the existence of a positive correlation between protein intrinsic disorder and sequence divergence during the evolutionary process. This higher sequence divergence provides strong support for the existence of disordered regions in p53 in vivo for if they were structured, they would evolve at similar rates as the rest of the protein.},

	abstract = {Understanding how ligand binding influences protein flexibility is important, especially in rational drug design. Protein flexibility upon ligand binding is analyzed herein using 305 proteins with 2369 crystal structures with ligands (holo) and 1679 without (apo). Each protein has at least two apo and two holo structures for analysis. The inherent variation in structures with and without ligands is first established as a baseline. This baseline is then compared to the change in conformation in going from the apo to holo states to probe induced flexibility. The inherent backbone flexibility across the apo structures is roughly the same as the variation across holo structures. The induced backbone flexibility across apo-holo pairs is larger than that of the apo or holo states, but the increase in RMSD is less than 0.5 Å. Analysis of χ1 angles revealed a distinctly different pattern with significant influences seen for ligand binding on side-chain conformations in the binding site. Within the apo and holo states themselves, the variation of the χ1 angles is the same. However, the data combining both apo and holo states show significant displacements. Upon ligand binding, χ1 angles are frequently pushed to new orientations outside the range seen in the apo states. Influences on binding-site variation could not be easily attributed to features such as ligand size or x-ray structure resolution. By combining these findings, we find that most binding site flexibility is compatible with the common practice in flexible docking, where backbones are kept rigid and side chains are allowed some degree of flexibility.},

Here, we extract the physical origins of this pattern by employing a statistical-mechanical model to construct conformational ensembles of three archetypal proteins. Through large-scale in silico alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we show that inter-residue differential coupling free energies, which are characteristic ensemble thermodynamic properties, follow a similar exponential distance dependence with the effects felt until ∼15–20 Å from the mutated site. From the perspective of an ensemble-averaged structure, this feature arises via long-range reorganization of the interaction network on mutations which is more significant for charged residues compared to hydrophobic residues. Our work highlights how subtle alterations in the microscopic distribution of states manifest as a macroscopic distance dependence, the physical origins of mutation-induced dynamic allostery, and the necessity to consider the global intra-protein interaction network to understand mutational outcomes.},

Hence, decoding how the primary amino acid sequence undergoes the transition to a defined secondary structure and its final three-dimensional fold is presently considered predictable with reasonable certainty. However, protein sequences that defy the first principles of secondary structure prediction (they attain two different folds) have recently been discovered. Such proteins, aptly named metamorphic proteins, decrease the conformational constraint by increasing flexibility in the secondary structure and thereby result in efficient functionality. In this review, we discuss the major factors driving the conformational switch related both to protein sequence and to structure using illustrative examples. We discuss the concept of an evolutionary transition in sequence and structure, the functional impact of the tertiary fold, and the pressure of intrinsic and external factors that give rise to metamorphic proteins. We mainly focus on the major components of protein architecture, namely, the α-helix and β-sheet segments, which are involved in conformational switching within the same or highly similar sequences. These chameleonic sequences are widespread in both cytosolic and membrane proteins, and these folds are equally important for protein structure and function. We discuss the implications of metamorphic proteins and chameleonic peptide sequences in de novo peptide design.},

A canonical example is how the scaffolding proteins NHERF1 and ezrin work in coordination to assemble crucial membrane complexes. As membrane–cytoskeleton scaffolding proteins, these provide excellent prototypes for understanding how regulatory signals are relayed through protein–protein interactions between the membrane and the cytoskeleton. Here, we review recent progress in understanding the structure and dynamics of the interaction. We describe recent novel applications of neutron spin echo spectroscopy to reveal the dynamic propagation of allosteric signals by nanoscale protein motion, and present a guide to the future study of dynamics and its application to the cure of disease.},

The Escherichia coli (E. coli) two-domain paralogs NusG and RfaH have conformationally identical N-terminal domains (NTDs) but dramatically different carboxy-terminal domains (CTDs), a β barrel in NusG and an α hairpin in RfaH. Both NTDs interact with elongating RNA polymerase (RNAP) to reduce pausing. In NusG, NTD and CTD are completely independent, and NusG-CTD interacts with termination factor Rho or ribosomal protein S10. In contrast, RfaH-CTD makes extensive contacts with RfaH-NTD to mask an RNAP-binding site therein. Upon RfaH interaction with its DNA target, the operon polarity suppressor (ops) DNA, RfaH-CTD is released, allowing RfaH-NTD to bind to RNAP. Here, we show that the released RfaH-CTD completely refolds from an all-α to an all-β conformation identical to that of NusG-CTD. As a consequence, RfaH-CTD binding to S10 is enabled and translation of RfaH-controlled operons is strongly potentiated.

The well-known “induced fit” hypothesis by Koshland implies multiconformational states of enzymes in equilibrium with one another easily perturbed by ligands. Each intermediary step during the entire catalytic process may require the molecule to be in a particular conformation state; rapid interconversion between the different conformation states may well be involved in the catalytic process. As a relative fragile and consequently flexible active site has now been envisaged, it appears that a rapid cycling of the different active site conformation states is essential for the full expression of enzyme activity.},

A recent analog is being developed as a candidate drug against several pathological conditions, including COVID-19. However, the reasons behind its higher potency and increased binding affinity to complement proteins are not fully clear. This computational study highlights the mechanistic properties of several compstatin analogs, thus complementing previous experimental studies. We perform molecular dynamics simulations involving six analogs alone in solution and two complexes with compstatin bound to complement component 3. These simulations reveal that all the analogs we consider, except the original compstatin, naturally adopt a pre-bound conformation in solution. Interestingly, this set of analogs adopting a pre-bound conformation includes analogs that were not known to benefit from this behavior. We also show that the most recent compstatin analog (among those we consider) forms a stronger hydrogen bond network with its complement receptor than an earlier analog.},

	abstract = {Structural analysis of proteins and nucleic acids is complicated by their inherent flexibility, conferred, for example, by linkers between their contiguous domains. Therefore, the macromolecule needs to be represented by an ensemble of conformations instead of a single conformation. Determining this ensemble is challenging because the experimental data are a convoluted average of contributions from multiple conformations. As the number of the ensemble degrees of freedom generally greatly exceeds the number of independent observables, directly deconvolving experimental data into a representative ensemble is an ill-posed problem. Recent developments in sparse approximations and compressive sensing have demonstrated that useful information can be recovered from underdetermined (ill-posed) systems of linear equations by using sparsity regularization. Inspired by these advances, we designed the Sparse Ensemble Selection (SES) method for recovering multiple conformations from a limited number of observations. SES is more general and accurate than previously published minimum-ensemble methods, and we use it to obtain representative conformational ensembles of Lys48-linked diubiquitin, characterized by the residual dipolar coupling data measured at several pH conditions. These representative ensembles are validated against NMR chemical shift perturbation data and compared to maximum-entropy results. The SES method reproduced and quantified the previously observed pH dependence of the major conformation of Lys48-linked diubiquitin, and revealed lesser-populated conformations that are preorganized for binding known diubiquitin receptors, thus providing insights into possible mechanisms of receptor recognition by polyubiquitin. SES is applicable to any experimental observables that can be expressed as a weighted linear combination of data for individual states.},

For the past fifty years, Koshland’s ‘induced fit’ hypothesis has been the textbook explanation for molecular recognition events. However, recent experimental evidence supports an alternative mechanism. ‘Conformational selection’ postulates that all protein conformations pre-exist, and the ligand selects the most favored conformation. Following binding the ensemble undergoes a population shift, redistributing the conformational states. Both conformational selection and induced fit appear to play roles. Following binding by a primary conformational selection event, optimization of side-chain and backbone interactions is likely to proceed by an induced fit mechanism. Conformational selection has been observed for protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and RNA-ligand interactions. These data support a new molecular recognition paradigm for processes as diverse as signaling, catalysis, gene regulation, and protein aggregation in disease, which has the potential to significantly impact our views and strategies in drug design, biomolecular engineering and molecular evolution.},

	abstract = {Several molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to sample conformations in the neighborhood of the native structure of holo-myoglobin (holo-Mb), collecting trajectories spanning 0.22μs at 300K. Principal component (PCA) and free-energy landscape (FEL) analyses, integrated by cluster analysis, which was performed considering the position and structures of the individual helices of the globin fold, were carried out. The coherence between the different structural clusters and the basins of the FEL, together with the convergence of parameters derived by PCA indicates that an accurate description of the Mb conformational space around the native state was achieved by multiple MD trajectories spanning at least 0.14μs. The integration of FEL, PCA, and structural clustering was shown to be a very useful approach to gain an overall view of the conformational landscape accessible to a protein and to identify representative protein substates. This method could be also used to investigate the conformational and dynamical properties of Mb apo-, mutant, or delete versions, in which greater conformational variability is expected and, therefore identification of representative substates from the simulations is relevant to disclose structure–function relationship.},

Praise for the first edition
"This book captures, in a very accessible way, a growing body of literature on the structure, function and motion of proteins. This is a superb publication that would be very useful to undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and instructors involved in structural biology or biophysics courses or in research on protein structure-function relationships." --David Sheehan, ChemBioChem, 2011
"Introduction to Proteins is an excellent, state-of-the-art choice for students, faculty, or researchers needing a monograph on protein structure. This is an immensely informative, thoroughly researched, up-to-date text, with broad coverage and remarkable depth. Introduction to Proteins would provide an excellent basis for an upper-level or graduate course on protein structure, and a valuable addition to the libraries of professionals interested in this centrally important field." --Eric Martz, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education, 2012},
